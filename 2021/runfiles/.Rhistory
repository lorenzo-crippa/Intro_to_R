# INTRODUCTION ----
# print("hello world!")
# Welcome to R! This is a comment: whatever follows the symbol # will not be executed by R.
# You can (and should) use comments to document your code and make it understandable by other users
# and to avoid running lines of code that you don't want your program to run.
# Today we're going to:
# 1) learn how to create objects in R and learn about the most common types of R objects
# 2) learn how to import and manage databases
# 3) learn how to obtain summary stats and plots using base R
# 4) learn how to perform basic statistical analyses
# 1) R DATA TYPES AND OBJECTS #----
## 1.1 R Data types ----
# We mainly use R to work with data. What are the main types of data we will deal with?
# Data can be
# 1. Numbers:
0
1.5
3/4
pi
# 2. Strings:
"Whatever"
"I'm"
"writing"
"now"
"hello!"
# 3. Categories: [England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland]
# 4. Logical:
TRUE
T
FALSE
F
## 1.2 Creating objects ----
# Data types can be contained in R objects.
# A number is an object, a dataset is an object, a plot is an object, a function too is an object.
# The environment in R can take multiple objects at the same time.
# In R we make vast use of the <- operator to assign values to objects.
# In RStudio you can obtain the operator quickly by typing the "alt" + "-" keys together.
# For instance:
a <- 2
# If you run this code ("ctrl" or "cmd" + "enter" to do it quickly) you'll see that you've assigned
# the value "2" to the object a. We can ask R to show us the content of an object:
a
b <- 5
a*b # the program returns the product of a and b, 10.
a+b
a-b
lorenzo*a*b # doesn't know lorenzo!
