## Introduction to R

### 2021 edition - 1X

Main change from 2020 edition has been a much stronger focus on `tidyverse`. 2020 version was introducing base R with only little `tidyverse` coding. It was leaving `ggplot2` introduction to a separate optional R script, and it was only introducing `ggplot2::qplot()`. 2021 version introduces base R and `tidyverse` in parallel.

Folders:

- `runfiles` contains class R code, exercises, and solutions

- `slides` contains LaTeX code used to generate slides

### 2020 edition - 1X

Folders:

- `datasets` contains data used by R files

- `r_files` contains class R code, exercises, solutions to exercises, and an extra R file to introduce ggplot2
